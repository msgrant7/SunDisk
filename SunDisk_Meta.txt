C-Code Files:
spa.c, spa.h, spa_tester.c


WINDOWS MinGW Compile:
- Open Windows command line/terminal with 'C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe' (or icon/shortcuts)
- cd to the C:\SunDisk directory
- build with 'gcc spa.c spa_tester_mg1.c -o spa_tester_mg1.exe'
  
  ( -OR-  use 'g++' in place of gcc'   and use some other suitable 'tester' file )
  

LINUX (CentOS Boxx PC) COMPILE (Build):

1) To compile and link 'spa.c,' the '-lm' option is used with 'gcc':

		'gcc spa.c spa_tester_mg1.c -lm -o spa_tester_mg1'

	where '-lm' actually specifies the library named 'libm.a,' following the 
	convention that some '-l[name]' is actually lib[name].a.  See?  (Refs)

	Note:  Library is an archive of object files, to be linked to your own
          compiled object file.

	Note:  Terminal 'whereis libm' yields: 
					libm: /usr/lib/libm.so /usr/lib/libm.a,  where

          - the '.so' (shared object) version is for dynamic/run-time linking
 			 - and .a (archive) is the static (compile & link time) version. 
  
	Note:  The <stdio.h> file will automatically cause 'gcc' to get the 'libc'
          library, so an explicit '-lc' (to get libc.a) is not needed.

2) Optionally, you can replace <math.h> with <cmath.h>, which seems to be
   automatically linked (at least on my CentOS/Boxx PC system).

3) Created a MAKEFILE (both a complicated and simple versions) to 
   allow building with a simple: 

				'make'  command (which uses the 'makefile' file.)


SETUP, COMPILE, and RUN:

1) Change CONSTANTS in the 'spa_tester_mg1.c' file according to DATE and 
   information at the NAVY WEBSITE:  
						http://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/ser7.dat
   
	NOTE: The 'DUT1' parameter changes daily and 
		- is equal to (UT1 - UTC):
		- is listed by date in the 'IERS BULLETIN - A' table, last column.
		- e.g. for 29 Dec 2015, DUT1 = -0.45649

	
2) Run with 'spa_tester_mg1.exe'   

	- Enjoy your winnings, Polly!
